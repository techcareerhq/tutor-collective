###Design Guidelines
The color palette for the overall site is available here: http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/3087487/BlueC 
We'll try to use these colors whenver possible. For calls to action or other elements that require a color outside of the palette, we'll defer to [Boostrap's default button styles](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/base-css.html#buttons)
